            <h2> Memetics</h2>
            <p>
                The core problem of memetics is the definition of the term meme and its ambiguity.
                Shifman (2013) separates memetics in three positions based on earlier work:
            <ul>1. mentalist-driven memetics is based on the differentiation between memes and
                meme vehicles. According to this school of thought, memes are complex ideas
                that reside in the brain. Memes need a vehicle (image, text, ritual) that is loaded
                with a complex idea, the meme. This means that the meme vehicles are tangible
                expressions and memes are only the idea.</ul>
            <ul>2. Behaviour-driven memetics sees memes as behaviours and artifacts rather than
                abstract ideas. In this model, the meme has no existence outside the vehicle and
                this means that it always presents itself in encoded information.</ul>
            <ul>3. Inclusive memetic approach is represented by Blackmore (1999) and it defines
                meme as any type of information; anything that can be imitated should be called
                a meme.</ul>

            <h2> Natural selection</h2>
            <p>
                Charles Darwin’s theory of natural selection (1859) is the fundament of Dawkins’
                (1990) theory of the selfish gene and later, memes. Darwin arguments that there are
                three main features that are required to natural selection to happen: variation, selection
                and retention. There must be variation so that not all creatures are identical. There must
                selection; an environment in which not all the creatures can survive and some do better
                than others. In addition, there must be a process of retention; something of the original
                meme must be retained for us to call it imitation. (Blackmore 1999, 10–14.)</br></br>

                Blackmore (1999, 57) says that memes are often successful because they are
                memorable, rather than because they are important or useful. Ideas that are meaningful
                or make sense to people are more likely to become memes than ideas that are not easily copied or
                understood by a large numbers of people (Knobel & Lankshear 2007, 201–
                202). The faster a meme spreads the more likely it is to capture attention and be
                replicated and distributed (Brodie 1996, 38).</br></br>

                Memetic selection is a process in which some memes grab the attention and get passed on to other people
                and some fail. There are many reasons why some memes succeed and others fail. Some are psychological
                facts; for example, memory of the human brain and attention, and limitations of our
                capacity to imitate. Also, humans are imitators and selectors as their nature; they are the
                replicating machinery and the selective environment for the memes. (Blackmore 1999). </br></br>

            <h2>Imitation</h2>
            <p>
                Memes replicate by imitation. Imitation is learning, at least according to some theories.
                Imitation is different from contagion and social learning. Contagion is inherent
                behavior, while social learning is learning about the environment through observing
                others. Imitation is learning something about the form of behaviour through observing
                others. (Heyes 1993, 999.) Just like genes, not all memes replicate successfully.
                Longevity, fecundity, and copying-fidelity are qualities that make for high survival
                value among memes (Dawkins 1990).</br></br>

                Fecundity of a meme presents its ability to spread, the capability to produce new
                growth, the number of copies made in a time unit. Some memes achieve short-term
                success and spread rapidly but do not last long in the meme pool (Dawkins 1990, 173).
                Longevity presents the life span of a meme. Copying-fidelity is how capable a meme is
                of spreading as alike as the original. Dawkins (1990, 174) says that it looks as if memes
                are not capable of being high fidelity and that meme transmission is subject to
                continuous mutation and to blending. Shifman (2013, 17) says that digitalization allows
                lossless information transfer so nowadays meme transmission has high copy-fidelity.
