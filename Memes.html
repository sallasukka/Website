            <h2> What are memes?</h2>
            <p>
                Internet memes are catchy pictures, videos, sound, or text that spread on
                the Internet. One of their features is viral, virus-like, spreading. Internet memes often
                spread through repetition and imitation, and people can relate to them. Modifying
                already existing material is also a quality of Internet memes. </br></br>

                Web 2.0, participatory culture, and social media are terms that describe the new kind of
                nature of the web that includes new technological choices, user
                participation more actively than before, and users having power to produce content.
                Web 2.0 technology increased the scope, range, and numbers of online communities and
                the forms of participation and communication available to their members.</br></br>

                Richard Dawkins, who has also studied genes, defines memes as units of cultural
                transmission or units of imitation. Few examples of memes are tunes, ideas,
                catchphrases, clothes fashions, ways of making pots, or building arches. (Dawkins
                1990, 171–172.) Memes are associated with a rapid uptake and spread of an idea
                presented as a written text, image, language, or some other unit of cultural stuff.</br></br>

                Dawkins explains memes through genes; genes propagate themselves in the gene pool
                by leaping from body to body and memes do the same in the meme pool by leaping
                from brain to brain. This leaping of memes can be called imitation. Memes can be
                fertile, in a sense that, if they parasitize the brain, they turn the brain into a vehicle for
                the meme and its propagation like a virus. (Dawkins 1990, 172.) This is why memes can
                be seen as viral (virus-like) and in the digital culture the term virality has been
                associated to Internet memes, too.</br></br>

                Shifman (2013) describes Internet memes as groups of digital items sharing common
                characteristics of content (the idea or the ideology of a specific text), form (the physical
                incarnation of the message which is perceived through our senses), and stance (the
                information a meme conveys about their own communication, how the addresser
                positions themselves in relation to the text) as a way to evaluate certain meme contents.

            <h2> Participatory culture</h2>

            <p> According to <strong>Jenkins</strong> (2006), the new participatory culture is taking shape at
                the intersection between three trends:
            <ul><strong>1.</strong> new tools and technologies enable users to archive, annotate, appropriate, and
                recirculate media content,</ul>
            <ul><strong>2.</strong> subcultures promote do-it-yourself media production, a discourse that shapes
                how consumers have utilized the new technologies, and</ul>
            <ul><strong>3.</strong> economic trends favor the media that encourages the flow of images, ideas, and
                narratives across multiple media channels and demand more active modes of
                spectatorship and participation. </ul></br>
            Jenkins (2010) describes remixing or sampling a part of participatory culture and as a process of taking
            culture (existing media content; music, film clips, image, etc.) apart and putting it back together. The web
            nowadays is more and more of a visual media.</br></br>
            Social media is one of the phenomena born from Web 2.0 and is associated with
            participatory culture. Social media refers to online communities that are participatory,
            conversational, and fluid. These communities enable members to produce, publish,
            control, critique, rank, and interact with online content. Social media exists in the
            context of communities. Users create and co-create, share, comment,
            and engage in content. Individuality, openness, and freedom are terms that describe
            online communities in the 21st century.

            <h2>Stickyness</h2>
            <p>Heath and Heath (2007) have found six principles of sticky content: simplicity,
                unexpectedness, concreteness, credibility, emotions, and stories. These principles increase the
                possibility for a meme to stick. However, memes hardly ever are all of this. It is possible that
                these six factors are underlying qualities of stickiness even in the digital world.</p></br></br>

            <table border="1">
